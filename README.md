### Project Goal 

The main goal of my website is to help a potential user to find quickly, without having to browes numerous pages, a  gift for his/her date.  

### Users Goals <br>
Each user visiting my site will be able to:

* Browse products within the store 
* Filter the products by categories and price
* See all products displayed on one page.
* Search products by key words
* Add products to the cart
* Remove products from the cart
* Go through checkout proccess
* To be able to place order with or without an account
* Sign up for an account
* Loginto his profile page to check or/and modify personal information
* See order history
* Leave a comment under a product (This feature still needs to be)fully developed

### Site Owner's Goals:

* Provide users with a safe and secure e-commerce platform in order to generate revenue from sales.
* Build awareness for the brand and attract new buyers.
* Collect user session data for market research purposes.
* Be able to add, edit or remove orders

### Wireframes 

 Here are the images of the wireframes, which I schetched out in my notebook before starting coding. Planning my project on the paper allowed me to visualize the final product and made it easier to execute it. 
<h2 align="center"><img src='/media/wireframes.JPG' style="margin: 0;"></h2>

### Design

Design
 * Colour Scheme
The four main colours used in my my site are light pink - for a site background, white - as some of image's background to make them stand out and dark grey - for text and the footer. Red often associated with love and passion is a predominant color of the Cupid Store products
 * Typography
For the development pupposes I used rather neutral, commonly used fonts that are easy to read, but in the further site development I am planning to change some of the  fonts into more handwritting style, which create an ambiance of intimacy and give a more personal feeling to the site.
* Imagery
The landing page is designed  to be striking and catch the user's attention with its warm and welcoming pink and stire curiosity and excitement with the red of two small hearts. A bit of glitter in the pink landing page background suggests luxury and promisses exciting shopping exxperience.






* Site Colors
<h2 align="center"><img src='/media/site_colors.png' style="margin: 0;"></h2>

### User Stories<br>
* My friend Tom said "Cupid Store is a good idea for people who don't wnat to spend hours browsing through many different sites in search of a good first date gift. Everything is there, you just pick the one you like and it will be beautiffully wrapped and delivered to your place. So it does save you a lot of time and energy that you would have to otherwise spend on looking for it.
* Cupid Store was also appealing to younger users. My friends children would come and start browsing throug the website for toys. They found bears and chocolates almost irresistible. Some of them brought their piggy bank money and wanted to be the first customers of Cupud Store. 
* Kate, who likes to have evrything done her way commented:' I wouldn't mind sending a link of Cupid Store to my boyfriend and  maybe even suggesting him my gift preferences. That way I can get what I trully like and it also saves him a headache of wondering if I liked it or not.

        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about coding challenges.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue red, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2. To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
